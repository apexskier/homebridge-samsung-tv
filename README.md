# Homebridge Samsung TV

This is my WIP homebridge plugin to control my Samsung TV.

I originally used https://github.com/tavicu/homebridge-samsung-tizen, but have had too many issues with it. Not sure if this'll solve them, but I found the architecture too complex and code an older style with over there.

## Features

- Turn TV on
- Turn TV off
- Show if TV is on or off
- Local only control, no remote connections

## Config

- Just include the IP of your TV, nothing else.
